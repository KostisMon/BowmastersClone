# BowmastersClone
A Bowmasters Clone game as part of a test assignment

This project made in 7 days in my free time after a 9-to-5 work from home.
The process of making it began by researching trajectories motion, in order to get a grasp of the movements that the projectiles would have. 

The art style was decided based on having limited time, and finding free assets on the Asset Store and editing some in Photoshop.
One major decision was to use Physics force for the projectile movement, giving it a more natural look.
Another decision was to rely on Unity’s Cinemachine for the camera system, this saved me precious time,
but also gave me a chance to use this very powerful tool (while only scraping its potentials).
I decided to use State Machine and Singleton Patterns for implementing my mechanics and general development.
As the time was limited and they suited the project's complexity I found those two, to be ideal for this test.

Animations, more physic based movements, power ups and “side quests” were some of the features I could have implemented given the time.
These features would have improve the aesthetics of the game but having limited time due to full-time work and respecting the time limit,
did not let me work on these.

-All sounds were free to use from ZapSlat (https://www.zapslat.com).

-The main asset pack was : Free Platform Game Assets from Bayat Games (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/free-platform-game-assets-85838).

-Logo and UI is from the asset pack : 20 Logo Templates with customizable PSD vector sources from Ruslan Kudriachenko (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/20-logo-templates-with-customizable-psd-vector-sources-174999)
